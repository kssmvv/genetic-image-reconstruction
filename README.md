# Genetic Image Reconstruction

A genetic algorithm that evolves random pixel populations to reconstruct target images using tournament selection, crossover, and mutation operators.

## How It Works

The algorithm treats image reconstruction as an optimisation problem. Each "individual" in the population is a full image, and the evolutionary loop improves these images generation by generation:

1. **Colour simplification** -- Every channel value is snapped to 0 or 255, dramatically reducing the search space while keeping recognisable structure.
2. **Initial population** -- Random images are generated by sampling pixels from the target's colour distribution.
3. **Fitness evaluation** -- The number of mismatched channel values between a candidate and the (simplified) target.
4. **Selection** -- Truncation selection keeps the top-*k* fittest individuals as parents.
5. **Crossover** -- Uniform crossover mixes parent pixels element-by-element to produce offspring.
6. **Mutation** -- A small fraction of pixels are randomly reassigned to new colours drawn from the genotype distribution.
7. **Replacement** -- Elitist replacement preserves the very best individuals while filling the rest with offspring.

Steps 3--7 repeat for a configurable number of generations.

## Features

- Multiple selection strategies: **tournament** and **truncation**
- Multiple crossover operators: **single-point** and **uniform**
- Multiple mutation operators: **random reassignment** and **swap**
- **Elitism-based replacement** to prevent losing the best solutions
- Search-space analysis and visualisation across image resolutions

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Place your target images in the project directory, then run:

```bash
python genetic_image_reconstruction.py
```

The default entry point reconstructs two sample images (`logo_gray_scale.png` and `logo_color.jpeg`). Edit the parameters in the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block to experiment with your own images.
